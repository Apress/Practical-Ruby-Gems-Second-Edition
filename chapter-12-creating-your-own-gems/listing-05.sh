Do you want to include a code of conduct in gems you generate?
Codes of conduct can increase contributions to your project
by contributors who prefer collaborative, safe spaces. You
can read more about the code of conduct at contributorcovenant.org. Having a code of conduct means agreeing to
the responsibility of enforcing it, so be sure that you are
prepared to do that. Be sure that your email address is
specified as a contact in the generated code of conduct so
that people know who to contact in case of a violation. For
suggestions about how to enforce codes of conduct, see https://
